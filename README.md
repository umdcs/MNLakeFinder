Minnesota Fish Advisory/Lakefinder android app
By Branton Fleischman, Daniel Niska, Dillon Cox

All code developed on Android Studio version 2.2.2
The master branch is a working branch that has all of the most updated code on it.

The API this app uses and gets all of it's information from is the MN DNR Lakefinder API:
·         Search by name: http://services.dnr.state.mn.us/api/lakefinder/by_name/v1
·         Search by id: http://services.dnr.state.mn.us/api/lakefinder/by_id/v1/
·         Search by point: http://services.dnr.state.mn.us/api/lakefinder/by_point/v1/

There is a node server connected to the app but we did not believe that this was an important part to the app so we did not put 
much time into this and therefore would need to be built to suit your needs if you wanted to add a more social aspect to this application.
